    <h2>Welcome to Arrow Photography</h2>
        The 2 important parts to capturing a photograph – &ndash; &mdash; the subject and the location.

    <h3>Adele and John's Wedding</h3>

    <p>
        &quot;Adele and John's Wedding&quot; &ldquo;Adele and John&rdquo; wanted some wedding photos of just
        themselves around Sydney Harbour with the <em>Sydney Opera House, Botanical
        Gardens</em> and <em>Sydney Harbour Bridge</em> as the backdrop. We met up with them
        one sunny afternoon on the Sydney Opera House steps and spent some time
        capturing some greats shots of them both in these awe-inspiring locations.
        After shooting in front of the Opera House and Bridge, we walked into <em>Sydney's
        Botanical Gardens</em> with the city behind them and captured some great natural
        moments between the two of them. After a glass or two of Champagne, we wandered
        through the gardens to <em>Mrs Macquaries Point</em> and photographed the bride and
        groom with the iconic <em>Opera House</em> and <em>Harbour Bridge</em> behind them.

    <h3>Jane and Richard's Wedding</h3>

    <p>
        Jane and Richard's Wedding Jane and Richard's wedding was at <em>St. Wilfrid's
        Church</em>, Calverley and the wedding reception took place at the <em>Mercure Parkway Hotel Leeds.</em>
        All the groomsmen were in kilts as the groom is Scottish and there was definitely
        a Scottish theme to the day. After the ceremony we were lucky enough for some
        sunshine to come out just at the right moment so the bride and groom could have
        the roof down on the wedding car. We worked quickly in the short time we had sun
        to capture some great photos of the bride and groom through the trees with the
        sunshine behind outside the <em>Mercure Parkway Hotel.</em> The wedding speeches had
        everyone in stitches as the best man had prepared a slideshow of photos from the stag do!
